## Workout Timer View

The Stopwatch View is the heart of the app—an intuitive and responsive interface that guides you through each workout in real time. It breaks down your session into reps, sets, and rounds, clearly displaying your current progress at every stage.

Key elements of the Stopwatch View include:

- Real-Time Countdown: A large, central timer shows the current interval—whether you're in an active rep or a rest phase—keeping you fully focused on the task.

- Progress Tracking: Visual indicators for rounds, sets, and reps help you stay oriented during complex routines.

- ~~Color-Coded Phases: Each workout phase is color-coded (e.g. green for active, red for rest), giving you instant visual feedback without needing to read labels.~~

- Audio & ~~Haptic~~ Cues: sounds or ~~vibrations~~ signal transitions between intervals, allowing hands-free operation during workouts.

- Pause/Resume Controls: Simple tap controls let you pause, skip, or reset at any point—perfect for adjusting on the fly.

- Minimalist Design: Clean layout with high contrast, ensuring readability even in sweaty or low-light conditions.
